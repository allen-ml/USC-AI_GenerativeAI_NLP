Steps to create new semester's website

1. Copy the current website data i.e. assets and USC_ITP_459_GEN_AI_NLP_Homepage.html file/folder and create a new folder in the Pastcourses folder with the semester name and paste the files in that. Follow the other semester's structure.
2. You will now have to update the header.html file. Add new semester in the dropdown like this <li class="dropdown-list"><a class="dropdown-item" href="/PastCourses/Spring2024/USC_ITP_459_GEN_AI_NLP_Homepage.html">Spring 2024</a></li>
3. Make sure to replace the Spring2024 in link and between the tags with the semester name. This will add new semster to all the "updated" pages.
4. Now update all the links in the past semester files, mostly image. Add absolute path and not relative path to images to load them properly.
5. For project creation copy the tempalte from any past semester, update the content and images accordingly and it's ready.
6. For new semester website, use the existing USC_ITP_459_GEN_AI_NLP_Homepage.html file. Add images to the assets folder only. Don't delete the staff images for old semester in any case as this may not load images in past semester.
7. Change the year in footer.html
8. If location or timing of the class change or semester change the header.html content accordingly.
9. while testing change the base to local host for rendering the images and rechange to original page link.
